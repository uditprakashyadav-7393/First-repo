# First-repo

A small personal repository used as a learning playground to try out different Git, GitHub, and development features.

Status: Experimental — actively used for practice and learning.
🌏[Live App](https://uditprakashyadav-7393/github.io/first-repo/.com)

## What this repository is for
- Experimenting with Git and GitHub workflows (branches, commits, PRs).
- Trying out basic project structure and README / documentation patterns.
- Practicing small code snippets, scripts, or configuration files.
- Learning features and tools (CI, linters, languages) as I explore them.

## Goals
- Keep a simple, clear place to practice.
- Record small examples and notes so I can revisit how things were done.
- Build confidence with version control and collaboration patterns.

## Features / Examples to try
- Creating and working with branches
- Opening and reviewing pull requests
- Adding CI or workflow examples (GitHub Actions)
- Small demo scripts in the language(s) I want to learn
- README and documentation improvements
- Adding tests and using linters

## Getting started (local)
Prerequisites:
